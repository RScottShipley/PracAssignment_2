This is a analysis of the vehicles dataset about used cars. It has around 436k data entries.
The purpose of this analysis is to identify any contributing factors to the price of a used car and what causes the price to rise or decline.
It is broken up into five different parts:
1. Overview of the data, business understanding
2. Understanding the data
3. Formatting the data and preparing it for some model.
4. Modeling the data, in this I used PolynomialFeatures and LinearRegression to model the data.
5. Evaluating the model and coming up with an answer to understand the analysis.
